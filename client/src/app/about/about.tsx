            Bake Ree began as a humble home kitchen tucked in a quiet
            neighborhood. The smell of warm, buttery croissants and freshly
            baked sourdough would drift from the windows and tempt every
            passerby. It wasn't a business then — just a passion project born
            from memories of Sunday mornings spent baking with family, and
            recipes scribbled in the margins of old cookbooks.
          </p>

            What started with simple loaves soon turned into layered cakes,
            delicate tarts, and pillowy donuts, all crafted with love and
            intention. Friends became loyal customers, and a small dining table
            turned into a counter full of flour-dusted trays and the laughter of
            a growing community.

            Our founder believed in creating moments — those little joys you
            feel when breaking bread with loved ones or surprising someone with
            their favorite sweet. From sourcing local eggs and seasonal fruits,
            to hand-folding every pastry, Bake Ree is built on care, heritage,
            and the courage to do things slowly and right.

            Every bite tells a story — of traditions honored, of innovation
            welcomed, and of smiles shared across generations. Whether it’s the
            richness of our cheesecake, the tang of our lemon tart, or the flake
            of our chocolate croissant, you’ll taste the commitment in every
            layer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Bake Ree is more than just a bakery. It’s a space where
            flavor and feeling come together. We believe that good food connects
            us, and we’re honored to be part of your celebrations, comfort, and
            everyday joys.
