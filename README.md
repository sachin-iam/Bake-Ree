# 🍞 Bake-Ree

**Bakery operations platform** — customer ordering + backoffice ERP + CRM + delivery + loyalty.

This README defines the **target skeleton** and **industry-level information architecture** for the system. It removes the old admin-only view and replaces it with a unified **Operations Console** (ERP + CRM + Ops).

---

## 📌 Vision & Status

- **Customer apps**: ordering, tracking, account, loyalty (existing + ongoing).
- **Operations Console**: replaces `/admin` with `/ops` and adds ERP + CRM in a single sidebar-driven workspace.
- **This document is the blueprint** for the full buildout (not all items are implemented yet).
